\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
    Parsers are a well-known computational resource in the Natural Language Processing area. However, it’s hard to find parsers for the Portuguese language.  While there are lots of rule-based parsing methods.
    
    Curiously, there is an interesting amount of pre-classified datasets for the Portuguese language, of easy access, that may be used for parsing training.
    % There are rule-based parsers, but the most know are the statistic ones, that need an adapted dataset for its training.
    
    In this work, we propose training a known parser, developed for the English language, with Portuguese language training data. For such, we \textit{transduce} the data of the original dataset format to the chosen parser dataset format, without lexical information loss.
    % portuguese language to english language, without lexical information loss.
