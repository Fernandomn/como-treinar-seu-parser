\begin{resumo}[Abstract]
 \begin{otherlanguage*}{english}
    Parsers are a well-known computational resource in Natural Language Processing area. However, its hard to find parsers for portuguese language. 
    % There are rule-based parsers, but the most know are the statistic ones, that need an adapted dataset for its training.
    While there are lots of rule-based
  parsing    
   methods,  Curiously, there are an interesting amount of pre-classified datasets for portuguese language, of easy access, that may be used for parsing training.
    
    In this work, we propose to training a known parser, developed for English language, with Portuguese language training data. For such, there'll be made the data \textit{transduction} of 
    % portuguese language to english language, without lexical information loss.
    of the original dataset format to the chosen parser dataset format, without lexical information loss.
