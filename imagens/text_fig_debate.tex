%  Eu gostaria de trazer um debate entre Alan Turing e Marvin Minsky. Turing, em \citeonline{turingJogoImitacao} postula: \textquote{The popular view that scientists proceed inexorably from well-established fact to well-established fact, never being influenced by any unproved conjecture, is quite mistaken}. Já Minsky como visto em \citeonline{Moor2006DartmouthIA}, demonstra descontentamento com o andamento da área. \textquote{Minsky expressed the concern that too many in AI today try to do what is popular and publish only successes. He argued that AI can never be a science until it publishes what fails as well as what succeeds.}
